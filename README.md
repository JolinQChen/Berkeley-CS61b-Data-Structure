# Berkeley-CS61b-Data-Structure
This repository contains projects of the course CS61b and can be considered as the implementation of data structure in Java.

## project 0
The goal for this project is to take in data files which contain information about objects, force, position, etc and to simulate the motion of the objects in a plane, accounting for the gravitational forces mutually affecting each object as demonstrated by Sir Isaac Newtonâ€™s Law of Universal Gravitation.
